the inspiration behind this work was my wife had 3 teeth pulled and couldnt talk very well so i had this idea!
i then had another idea to add a bunch of comments in the .sh script it self to help others that might be struggling with bash.
also a side note the script it self also works in termux of course so she could take the quiz/report on my cell phone.
i hope this script along with comments can help you also learn things that can help you or some one else.

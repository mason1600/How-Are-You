The Inspiration Behind This Work was my wife had 3 teeth pulled and couldnt talk very well so i had this idea!
I then had another idea to add a bunch of comments in the .sh script it self to help others that might be struggling with bash.
Also a side note the script it self also works in termux of course so she could take the quiz/report on my cell phone any where any time.
I hope this script along with comments can help you also learn things that can help you or someone else.
